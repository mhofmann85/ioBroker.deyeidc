## deyeidc adapter for ioBroker

Data Collector vor Deye-compatible Inverter

## Usage

To commission the adapter, the register ranges and coils must be entered in the GUI in addition to the IP address and the logger serial number in the following pages. There is already an example entry for this.
Certain values are not supplied by the inverter and must be calculated independently. For this purpose, two values per line can be entered in the 'compute' table, which are then multiplied.

### Coils

| Rules | Descriptions |
| --- | --- | 
| 0 |  raw_signed |
| 1 |  für 16-bit-unsigned Values |
| 2 |  für 16-bit-signed Values |
| 3 |  für 32-bit-unsigned Values |
| 4 |  für 32-bit-signed Values |
| 5 |  Serialnumber |
| 6 |  Temperature |
| 7 |  Versionsnumber |
| 8 |  SingleBytes (MSB) |
| 9 |  SingleBytes (LSB) |

### Factor
__Factor__ is used for calculating actual used factor. The formula is: `value = value * -2^factor`

### Getting started

This adapter makes it possible to read out data from an inverter in the local network. This data is retrieved via the known Modbus ports and stored in the data points. This was developed and tested on a "Deye-compatible" inverter. The registers to be queried may therefore differ on other models.
For this, only the IP of the inverter and the serial number of the logger must be entered. If the port differs from the default value, it can also be adjusted. 60 seconds has been preset as a practicable value for the sampling rate.
